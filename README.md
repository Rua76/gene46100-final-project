## 🧬 Puffin Model Repository

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for training, evaluating, and comparing the original Puffin model and a new architecture (files marked with `newModel`). The project includes multi-stage training pipelines, evaluation routines, and visualizations.

## 📁 File Descriptions

### 🔧 Training Scripts

- `train_puffin_stage1.py`  
  Trains the original Puffin model (Stage 1).

- `train_puffin_stage1_newModel.py`  
  Trains the new Puffin model architecture (Stage 1).

- `train_puffin_stage2.py`  
  Trains the original Puffin model (Stage 2), typically for fine-tuning.

- `train_puffin_stage2_newModel.py`  
  Trains the new Puffin model architecture (Stage 2).

- `train_puffin_stage2_combine.py`  
  Trains a version of the Puffin model using a combined old+new workflow.

---

### 📊 Evaluation Scripts

- `evaluate_stage2_model.py`  
  Evaluates the original Puffin model after Stage 2 training.

- `evaluate_stage2_newModel.py`  
  Evaluates the new model architecture after Stage 2 training.

---

### 📓 Notebooks

- `Process_models.ipynb`  
  Notebook for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the original model.

- `original_Process_models.ipynb`  
  Previous version of the original processing notebook, preserved for reference.

- `Process_models_new.ipynb`  
  Updated notebook for the new model architecture workflow.

---

### 🗃️ Evaluation Outputs & Logs

- `puffin_eval_9motifs`  
  Contains evaluation results for the old+new model across 9 motifs.

- `puffin_eval_newModel`  
  Contains evaluation results for the new model architecture.

- `puffin_eval_log`  
  Stores raw logs and metrics from evaluation runs.

---

### 🖼️ Visualization Archives

- `original_puffin_plots.zip`  
  Archive of visualizations generated by the original model.

- `new_puffin_plots.zip`  
  Archive of visualizations generated by the new model.
