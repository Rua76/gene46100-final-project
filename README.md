## 🧬 Puffin Model Repository

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for training, evaluating, and comparing the original Puffin model and a new architecture (files marked with `newModel`). The project includes multi-stage training pipelines, evaluation routines, and visualizations.

- `train_puffin_stage2.py`  
  Trains the original Puffin model (Stage 2)

- `train_puffin_stage2_newModel.py`  
  Trains the new Puffin model architecture (Stage 2).

- `train_puffin_stage2_combine.py`  
  Trains a version of the Puffin model using a combined old+new workflow.

---

### 📊 Evaluation Scripts

- `evaluate_stage2_model.py`  
  Evaluates the original Puffin model after Stage 2 training.

  Contains evaluation results and plots for the old+new.

- `puffin_eval_newModel/`  
  Contains evaluation results for the new model architecture.

- `puffin_eval_log/`  
  Stores raw logs and metrics from evaluation runs.

---

### 🖼️ Visualization Archives

- `original_puffin_plots.zip`  
  Archive of visualizations generated by the original model.

- `new_puffin_plots.zip`  
  Archive of visualizations generated by the new model.

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 1. 📦 Install Environment

Use the provided `puffin.yml` file to create the conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f puffin.yml
conda activate puffin
```

### 2. Train Stage 1 Model
Run the Stage 1 training script:
```bash
python train_puffin_stage1.py [index]          # Original model
 or
python train_puffin_stage1_newModel.py [index]     # New model
```
### 3. Process Models with Notebooks
Launch and run the appropriate notebook
